## Conditions of the assignments:

## 1) Write a console program that reads a grade (fractional number) entered by the user and prints "Excellent!" if the grade is 5.50 or higher.

## 2) Write a program that reads two integers entered by the user and prints the larger of the two.

## 3) Write a program that reads an integer entered by the user and prints whether it is even or odd.
If even print "even", if odd print "odd".

## 4) Write a program that reads a password (text) entered by the user and checks whether the entered password matches the phrase "s3cr3t!P@ssw0rd". If there is a match, display "Welcome". In case of mismatch, display "Wrong password!".

## 5) Write a program that reads an integer entered by the user and checks whether it is less than 100, between 100 and 200, or greater than 200. If the number is:

• under 100 print: "Less than 100"

• between 100 and 200 print: "Between 100 and 200"

• greater than 200 print: "Greater than 200"

## 6) Write a program that reads speed (real number) entered by the user and prints speed information.

• For speed up to 10 (inclusive) print "slow"

• For speed over 10 and up to 50 (inclusive) print "average"

• For speed over 50 and up to 150 (inclusive) print "fast"

• For speed over 150 and up to 1000 (inclusive) print "ultra fast"

• For higher speed, print "extremely fast"

## 7) Write a program in which the user enters the type and dimensions of a geometric figure and calculates its face. There are four types of figures: square, rectangle, circle and triangle. The first line of the input reads the type of figure (text with the following options: square, rectangle, circle or triangle).

• If the figure is a square: a fractional number is read on the next line - the length of its side

• If the figure is a rectangle: on the next two lines read two fractional numbers - the lengths of its sides

• If the figure is a circle: on the next line read a fractional number - the radius of the circle

• If the figure is a triangle: on the next two lines read two fractional numbers - the length of its side and the length of the height to it

Round the result to 3 decimal places.
