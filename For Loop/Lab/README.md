## Conditions of the assignments:

## 1) Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 100, each on a new line.

## 2) Write a program that reads a positive integer n entered by the user and prints the numbers n through 1 in reverse order. The number n entered will always be greater than 1.

## 3) Write a program that reads a number n entered by the user and prints the numbers 1 through n through 3.

## 4) Write a program that reads a number n entered by the user and prints the even powers of 2 ≤ 2n: 2^0, 2^2, 2^4, 2^6, …, 2^n.

## 5) Write a program that reads text (string) entered by the user and prints each character of the text on a separate line.

## 6) Write a program that reads text (string) entered by the user and calculates and prints the sum of the vowel values according to the table below:

## 7) Write a program that reads n-th number of integers entered by the user and sums them.

### • The number of numbers n is entered from the first line of the input.

### • One whole number is entered from the next n lines.

### The program must read the numbers, add them, and print the sum.

## 8) Write a program that reads n number of integers. Print the largest and smallest number among those entered.

## 9) Write a program that reads 2 * n number of user-supplied integers and checks whether the sum of the first n numbers (left sum) is equal to the sum of the second n numbers (right sum). If there is a tie, print " Yes, sum = " + the sum; otherwise it prints " No, diff = " + the difference. The difference is calculated as a positive number (in absolute value).

## 10) Write a program that reads n-th number of integers supplied by the user and checks whether the sum of the numbers in even positions is equal to the sum of the numbers in odd positions.

### • If the sums are equal, print two lines: "Yes" and on a new line "Sum = " + the sum;

### • If the amounts are not equal, print two lines: "No" and on a new line "Diff = " + the difference.

### The difference is calculated in absolute value.
