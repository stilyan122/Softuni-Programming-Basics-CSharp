## Conditions of the assignments:

## 1) Write a program that reads text from the console (string) and prints it until it receives the "Stop" command.

## 2) Write a program that initially reads a user profile name and password. It then reads a login password.

### • when entering a wrong password: prompt the user to enter a new password.

### • when entering a correct password: we print "Welcome {username}!".

## 3) Write a program that reads an integer from the console and on each successive line integers until their sum is greater than or equal to the original number. After completion, print the sum of the entered numbers.

## 4) Write a program that reads a number n entered by the user and prints all numbers ≤ n from the sequence: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, …. Each subsequent number is calculated by multiplying the previous one by 2 and adding 1.

## 5) Write a program that calculates how much total money is in the account after you make a certain number of deposits. On each line you will receive the amount you need to deposit into the account until you receive a "NoMoreMoney" command. For each amount received, the console should display "Increase: " + the amount and add it to the account. If you get a number less than 0 the console should display "Invalid operation!" and the program to end. When the program ends, it should print "Total: " + the total amount in the account formatted to the second decimal place.

## 6) Write a program that, until receiving the "Stop" command, reads integers entered by the user and finds the largest among them. Enter one number per line.

## 7) Write a program that, until receiving the "Stop" command, reads integers entered by the user and finds the smallest number among them. Enter one number per line.

## 8) Write a program that calculates the grade point average of a student over his entire course. On the first row, you will get the student's name, and on each subsequent row, their annual grades. The student advances to the next grade if his annual grade is greater than or equal to 4.00. If the student is interrupted more than once, the student is expelled and the program ends, printing the name of the student and the class in which he was expelled.

### On successful completion of 12th grade to print:

### "{student name} graduated. Average grade: {the average grade of the entire study}"

### In case the student is excluded from school, print:

### "{student name} has been excluded at {grade in which he was excluded} grade"
